From top to bottom, the notch angles are 0 degrees, 1 degree, 0.5 degrees
0.25 degrees, and 0.1 degree. The size of each square is based on the size 
of the straight sections of a notch wrist in a 4928 x 3264 pixel image. The 
notches can be bigger or smaller depending on how close the camera is. 
These images are meant to test the accuracy of the image analyzer and show 
that it is repeatable for a 1 degree of change in the wrist.

Additionally, there is a single image of an actual notched wrist.
